# Bread-Multithreaded-Authentication-System-

# Overview
    Bread is a custom-built, multi-threaded authentication system designed to provide secure access to the Chacha 
    Shell. Chacha Shell is a lightweight and intuitive command-line interface (CLI) that enables users to perform 
    essential file and directory management tasks, such as creating directories, moving files, deleting items, and 
    listing contents. The Bread authentication system ensures that only authenticated users can access these 
    functionalities.

    Built with a custom data structure and multi-threaded support, Bread handles authentication requests efficiently 
    and securely, allowing multiple users to authenticate simultaneously. Once a user is authenticated, they can 
    seamlessly interact with Chacha Shell and perform file management operations.

# Features
 # Multi-threaded Authentication
    1)Concurrency: Handles multiple authentication requests simultaneously, making it efficient for high-load env 
      ironments.
    2)Custom Data Structure - Bread
    3)Optimized for Speed: The Bread data structure provides fast and efficient access to user credentials.
    4)Secure Login: Ensures passwords and login information are securely handled.
 # Chacha Shell Integration
    1)Secure File System Access: Only authenticated users can interact with the Chacha Shell command-line interface 
      for file management tasks.
    2)User-Friendly Interface: Once authenticated, users can use Chacha Shell's commands to navigate and manage the 
      file system.
    3)Commands Available in Chacha Shell
 Once authenticated, users can execute the following commands within Chacha Shell:

      chacha dir <directory_name>: Creates a new directory.
      chacha mv_to <directory_path>: Moves to a specific directory.
      chacha add_file <file_path> <file_name>: Adds a file to the current directory.
      chacha delete <file_name>: Deletes a file from the current directory.
      chacha rmdir <directory_name>: Deletes a directory.
      chacha lst: Lists items in the current directory.
      exit: Exits the shell.
 # Error Handling and Feedback
    1)Invalid Login: If authentication fails, the system provides clear error messages, prompting the user to try 
      again.
    2)Command Feedback: After executing a command, Chacha Shell provides clear feedback to the user, indicating 
      success or failure.
# Thread-Safe Design
Concurrency Management: Bread supports multiple users authenticating concurrently, ensuring the system remains 
responsive.
# Example Usage - Authentication Flow Example
    Login Prompt:
    
    bash

    Please enter your username: user1
    Please enter your password: ********
    
    Authentication successful! Access granted to Chacha Shell.
    :) chacha> 
    
    If Authentication Fails:
    
    bash
    Copy code
    Invalid credentials. Please try again.
    Please enter your username: user1
    Please enter your password: ********
    
    Authentication failed. Access denied.
    
    After Authentication
    Once authenticated, users can enter Chacha Shell and begin using its commands:
    
    Create a Directory:
    
    bash
    Copy code
    :) chacha> chacha dir "Projects"
    Directory "Projects" created successfully.
    
    Change to a Specific Directory:
    
    bash
    Copy code
    :) chacha> chacha mv_to "/home/user/Documents"
    Moved to "/home/user/Documents".
    
    Add a File:
    
    bash
    Copy code
    :) chacha> chacha add_file "notes.txt" "backup_notes.txt"
    File "notes.txt" added as "backup_notes.txt".
    
    Delete a File:
    
    bash
    Copy code
    :) chacha> chacha delete "old_file.txt"
    File "old_file.txt" deleted successfully.
    
    List Directory Contents:
    
    bash
    Copy code
    :) chacha> chacha lst
    Listing items in the current directory:
    - Projects
    - notes.txt
    - backup_notes.txt
    How to Build and Use

# Code Highlights

    1)Multi-threading with Bread
    2)Concurrent User Authentication: Handles multiple user authentications concurrently, ensuring scalability and 
      responsiveness.
    3)Thread-Safe Data Structures: Ensures safe access to credentials, preventing race conditions.
    4)Secure Login Process
    5)Encrypted Password Handling: Passwords are stored securely using encryption techniques to safeguard user 
      information.
    6)Error Handling: Bread provides helpful error messages when authentication fails, guiding users to successful 
     login.
    7)Seamless Chacha Shell Access
    
    After successful authentication, users can access the Chacha Shell and perform commands for managing files and 
    directories.

# Potential Expansions

    1)User Roles: Implement roles (e.g., admin, user) with varying access levels for better access control.
    2)Multi-Factor Authentication: Add support for multi-factor authentication for additional security.
    3)Custom Command Aliases: Allow users to define custom aliases for frequently used commands, simplifying the 
      workflow.
    4)Session Management: Add time-based or activity-based session control to improve security.
